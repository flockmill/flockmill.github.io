Dear Residents of Flockmill,

Re: Central Park Waste Collection and Disposal

You might have noticed that there has been a temporary change to the arrangements for waste
collection and disposal in the common property Central Park area of Flockmill since the new
contractors commenced their operations. The Owners Corporation Committee would like to give
you the opportunity to contribute to the decision making process with regard to the options for
waste collection in the common property on a permanent basis.

- Why are we replacing our existing bins?

  - Our waste disposal contractors are unable to manually empty the old round 80l
    bins due to their OH&S policy. They have supplied a new red 120l wheelie bin,
    which we need to manage.

- Why do we need a bin enclosure?

  - Security: To minimise theft of the wheelie bin and keep it secured in the designated
    area of the common property.
  - Improved management: limitation of the opening to minimise disposal of large
    rubbish items; birds opening the lid and getting to the rubbish; bin lid being left
    open to the weather and general protection from the weather.
  - Safety: Limited access for anyone tempted to remove items from the bin, e.g.
    Diving for refundable cans and bottles.

- Where do we go from here?

  - The Property SubCommittee and the Sustainability SubCommittee met twice as a
    combined group to look at options and make recommendations for the Owners
    Corporation Committee's consideration. After looking at all the options, a clear
    consensus was reached and a recommendation was made.

- What is the proposed option?

  {{< figure src="/images/2024/Woodbury–BN50.png" alt="Woodbury BN50 Bin enclosure" width="200px" class="float-left-wrap">}}

  Purchase and install a Woodbury – BN50 enclosure manufactured by
  Urban Design Group to secure the new wheelie bin.

  Features:

  - Natural timber is easy to maintain as part of the regular maintenance
    of stained timber surfaces at Community Working Bees.
  - Enclosure design is in keeping with existing design language and
    materials of the timber top picnic table and seating
  - Lockable: Industry standard triangular key, stainless steel hinges
  - A more discrete palette was considered to be appropriate and help it to blend into
    the environment rather than be a standout feature.
  - The proximity to the picnic table lends itself to stained timber, with a powder
    coated steel frame in Monument colour to match existing balcony exteriors and
    window frames.

- What are the cost implications?

  - The cost of the recommended enclosure is $2189, with delivery an additional $176.
    This amount was allowed for in the 2024/25 OC Budget.
  - Installation will be completed by Flockmill community volunteer labour organised
    by the Property SubCommittee, which represents a significant cost saving.
  - The contractor will access the enclosure and empty the bin for the standard rate,
    currently $5.50 per lift. Flexible pickup options are available, with the contractor
    suggesting a weekly pickup in summer reverting to fortnightly in Autumn, Winter
    and Spring due to lower demand, at a total annual cost of $179.00

- What will happen to the old bins and enclosures?

  - They have been removed and are being stored temporarily until we gain approval
    from the OC to either sell them or dispose of them as a donation to a local
    community group or school.
  - Suggestions for suitable recipients will be gratefully received by the OCC once
    approval has been granted.

  To advise the OCC of your preferred option, please open the link and respond to the
  survey which will be sent in a separate email. Whilst multiple surveys may be sent to the
  proprietors of the same townhouse (Lot), only one response can be accepted. Therefore,
  please consult with members of your lot to reach consensus on your response before
  submitting the survey.

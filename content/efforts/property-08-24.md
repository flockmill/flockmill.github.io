Working to clear priority items:

  materials; etc) including review and verification.
- Review of asset maintenance items: due diligence on: costs; fit-for-intended-purpose;
  projected vs actual maintenance schedule and depreciation.
- Stewart St driveway: Co-ordinated owner volunteers to replace a 2 metre section of loose
  bluestone pavers with reinforced concrete.
- Central Park pedestrian pathway: re-laid two sections of bluestone pavers, which had buckled
  due to heat expansion. Expansion joints to be cut into the path at regular intervals.

  applied barrier spray.

  original Christie lid. Fitted new lid to protect internal fittings from rainwater ingress.

  and thinned, cobwebs removed from light bollards, letter boxes and external balcony surfaces,

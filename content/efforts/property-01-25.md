Dear Residents of Flockmill,

The Common Property SubCommittee is pleased to share an update on activities planned for the
coming year.

## Common Property Waste Collection

Following the recent survey sent to the Owners Corporation members, those who responded
overwhelmingly endorsed the provision of a red bin secured in the recommended enclosure, and
the donation of the old round bin enclosures to a not for profit organisation. The OC Committee
has authorised Tideways to order the recommended Woodbury BN50 from the supplier, Urban
Design Group. Delivery will be arranged within four to six weeks, and will be installed on the
existing concrete pad near the drink tap. If you know of a not for profit who might be able to make use of the old yellow enclosures, please let us know.

## Community Working Bee

A working bee has been planned for the weekend of 8th and 9th of February, so please save your
preferred date in your calendar. We plan to complete the following tasks, and any others that are
suggested in the meantime.

- Clean stains on the concrete benches in BBQ area
- Treat rust on the stainless steel cables and fittings on pergola
- Re-secure light fittings on pergola beams over the BBQ
- Treat pergola beams with wood hardener
- Treat rust on bike maintenance station
- Empty BBQ grease trap
- Remove spider webs from fences, letter boxes and electrical switchboards
- Remove flaking surface of fibreglass planter tubs and re-paint/re-coat
- Prepare for installation of new rubbish bin enclosure
- Remove concrete base from old rubbish bin enclosure at south end of central park
- Landscaping tasks as determined by the Landscape SubCommittee

## Central Park Area Maintenance

Thank you to those residents who assisted with the recovery of the lawn in central park by
keeping oﬀ the area following the top dressing which was applied and the weeding that took
place. It was pleasing to see the way the turf recovered from such a bare cover, although there is still work to be done to see the lawn growing the way it should. Please continue to limit vigorous activities on the lawn during this period.

The storm water drain on Stage 3 has been repaired and stabilised to make it eﬀective in limiting
the overflow of storm water which was saturating the lawn during sustained rain events in winter.

## Common Property Asset Register

The SubCommittee is working to update and audit the Common Property Asset Register which
will be used to inform the 10 Year Maintenance Plan which is currently being prepared. This will
ensure that the assets of the Flockmill development will be properly managed and maintained in
the years to come.

Kind regards,  
Rick Gordon  
For the Common Property Sub Committee

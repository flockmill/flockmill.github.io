Dear Flockmill,

We are contacting you to explain why we need to replace the two 80-litre bins in the central park area with a 120-litre bin.

## Why?

The Owners Corporation has a legal obligation to comply with the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 2004 (Vic). The current 80-litre bins require a specific waste collection service with the correct Occupational Health and Safety and Work Health and Safety insurances and resources to lift, carry, and empty the bins. None of the contractors that were shortlisted for our waste collection were able to provide that service.

## The 120-Litre Bin

Accordingly, our new waste contractor, Vic Enviro Waste Services, has supplied a 120-litre general waste bin which they are able to empty safely. Members of our Common Property and Sustainability SubCommittees will conduct a search to find the most suitable and cost-effective enclosures for the bin. A survey will be developed to enable owners to participate in the selection of the design of the new enclosure or security solution for the 120-litre bin. We are also open to suggestions as to what we can do with the old yellow bins.

## Until Thenâ€¦

The two 80-litre bins have now been removed so that residents can start using the provided 120-litre bin, which will then be emptied as part of our weekly service. As per previous requests, waste that can be recycled will still need to be disposed of in your household-recycling bin. We would also like to take this opportunity to gently remind residents that the disposal of your household rubbish into the common property bin is prohibited.

As always, please do not hesitate to contact me or any of the Common Property or Sustainability SubCommittee members if you have any suggestions or queries.

Regards,
Rick Gordon
Chair on b/h PS820854T Common Property SubCommittee

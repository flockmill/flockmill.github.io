Strengthening the resilience and usability of our technology and security.
Review and consolidation of the following assets:

- Security Cameras.
  - Procure a new CCTV/security contractor to reprogram and set up cameras on an
    independent secure server, ensuring the system is not linked to any individual.
- Public lighting automation.
  - Research and install new hardware to automate public lighting, allowing it to adjust
    automatically to current sunrise and sunset times. This will result in approximately a 12%
    reduction in electricity bills, saving around $160 per year.
- Technology Cabinet.
  - Develop, install, and test a new automation hub to support Flockmill's future needs.
- Secure a new Internet service provider to replace our previous, underperforming provider.
- Onsite maintenance of technology assets.

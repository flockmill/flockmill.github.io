Works undertaken by Landscape SubCommittee has been the completion of the:

- Landscape Master Plan (LMP) ready for comment and approval by the OC. The LMP includes
  the future direction for the landscape including expansion of the plant diversity and additional
  tree planting.

  Care document is the guidelines and requirements for an Owner to take on and choose the
  direction of the common area garden located directly in front of their townhouse. Owners at
  their own cost can choose the planting arrangement and species from the LMP for the subject
  area.
- Additional and renewed herbs and veggie stock have been planted and updated for the
  season.

    pipes; programming checks of irrigation system; replacement planting.
